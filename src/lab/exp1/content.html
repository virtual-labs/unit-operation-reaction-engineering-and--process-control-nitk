<b>Experiment No.1</b></br>
<b>FLOW THROUGH PIPES</b></br>
<b>Background and Theory</b></br></p>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap"> Pipe flow under pressure is used for a lot of purposes. A fundamental
understanding of fluid flow is essential to almost every industry related with
chemical engineering. In the chemical and manufacturing industries, large flow
networks are necessary to achieve continuous transport of products and raw
materials from different processing units. This requires a detailed understanding of
fluid flow in pipes. Energy input to the gas or liquid is needed to make it flow
through the pipe. This energy input is needed because there is frictional energy loss
(also called frictional head loss or frictional pressure drop) due to the friction
between the fluid and the pipe wall and internal friction within the fluid. In pipe
flow substantial energy is lost due to frictional resistances.</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
One of the most common problem in fluid mechanics is the estimation of this
pressure loss. Calculating pressure losses is necessary for determining the
appropriate size pump.
Knowledge of the magnitude of frictional losses is of
great importance because it determines the power requirements of the pump
forcing the fluid through the pipe. For example, in refining and petrochemical
industries, these losses have to be calculated accurately to determine where booster
pumps have to be placed when pumping crude oil or other fluids in pipes to
distances thousands of kilometres away.

</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
Pipe losses in a piping system result from a number of system characteristics,
which include among others; pipe friction, changes in direction of flow,
obstructions in flow path, and sudden or gradual changes in the cross-section and
shape of flow path.

</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
In this experiment, pressure loss measurements are made as a function of
flowrate on different pipe components namely; a) straight pipe, (b)globe valve (c)
o
gate valve (d)an Expander (e)Reducer (f)standard elbow (g) 90 Bend.
</div></br>


<b>Resistance to flow in a pipe</b></br></br>
<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
When a fluid flows through a pipe, the internal roughness of the pipe wall
can create local eddy currents within the fluid adding a resistance to flow of the
fluid. The velocity profile in a pipe will show that the fluid elements in the center
of the pipe will move at a higher speed than those closer to the wall. . Therefore
friction will occur between layers within the fluid. This movement of fluid
elements relative to each other is associated with pressure drop, called frictional
losses. Pipes with smooth walls such as glass, copper, brass and polyethylene have
only a small effect on the frictional resistance. Pipes with less smooth walls such as
concrete, cast iron and steel will create larger eddy currents which will sometimes
have a significant effect on the frictional resistance. Rougher the inner wall of the
pipe, more will be the pressure loss due to friction.
</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">

As the average velocity increases, pressure losses increase. Velocity is
directly related to flow rate.</br>


Velocity=Volumetric flow rate /Cross sectional area of the pipe.
</div>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
An increase or decrease in flow rate will result in a corresponding increase or
decrease in velocity. Smaller pipe causes a greater proportion of the liquid to be in
contact with the pipe, which creates friction. Pipe size also affects velocity. Given
a constant flow rate, decreasing pipe size increases the velocity, which increases
friction. The friction losses are cumulative as the fluid travels through the length of
pipe. The greater the distance, the greater the friction losses will be. Fluids with a
high viscosity will flow more slowly and will generally not support eddy currents
and therefore the internal roughness of the pipe will have no effect on the frictional
resistance. This condition is known as laminar flow.
</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" >
There are in general three types of fluid flow in pipes
 <ul>
  <li>laminar</li>
  <li>turbulent</li>
  <li>transient</li>
</ul> 



<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap"><u><b>Laminar flow</b></u></br>
Laminar flow generally happens when dealing with small pipes , low flow
velocities and with highly viscous fluids. At low velocities fluids tend to flow
without lateral mixing,and adjacent layers slide past one another like playing cards.
There are neither cross currents nor eddies. Laminar flow can be regarded as a
series of liquid cylinders in the pipe, where the innermost parts flow the fastest,
and the cylinder touching the pipe isn't moving at all.</br></br>
<u><b>Turbulent flow</b></u></br>
In turbulent flow, the fluid moves erratically in the form of cross currents and
eddies. Turbulent flow happens in general at high flow rates and with larger pipes.</br></br>
<u><b>Transitional flow</b></u></br>
Transitional flow is a mixture of laminar and turbulent flow, with turbulence in the
center of the pipe, and laminar flow near the edges.
</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
Each of these flows behave in different manners in terms of their frictional
energy loss while flowing, and have different equations that predict their
behavior.Reynolds studied the conditions under which one type of flow changes
into the other and found that the critical velocity ,at which laminar flow changes
into turbulent flow ,depends on four quantities: the diameter of the tube, viscosity,
density and average velocity of the liquid. He found that these four factors can be
combined into one group and that the change in kind of flow occurs at a definite
value of the group. The grouping of the variables so found was Reynolds Number(<img src="../images/CodeCogsEqn (1).gif" style="width:30px;height:12px"></img>)
.Turbulent or laminar flow is determined by Reynolds Number.</br></br>

motion) forces to viscous forces.</br></br><!--

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
The Reynolds number is important in analyzing any type of flow when there is
substantial velocity gradient (i.e. shear.) It indicates the relative significance of the
viscous effect compared to the inertia effect.
</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">

The flow is
 <ul>
  <li>laminar when N<sub>Re</sub>< 2100</li>
  <li>turbulenttransient when 2100 < N <sub>Re</sub>< 4000 </li>
  <li>transient turbulent when 4000 < N<sub>Re</sub></li>
</ul> 
</br>
At laminar region,viscous forces are dominant as compared to inertial forces.
Under laminar flow condition the pressure drop per unit length is proportional to
the velocity. At transition region, the experimental results are not reproducible.
Finally, at turbulent region, inertial forces are dominant. For turbulent flow, the
pressure drop becomes proportional to the velocity raised to a power of 2.

<b>
Relationship Between Frictional Head Loss and
Frictional Pressure Drop</b></br>
</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
The energy loss in pipe flow due to friction can be expressed as a pressure
drop instead of as a head loss. Chemical and mechanical engineers often work with
pressure drop, whereas civil engineers usually work with head loss. The
relationship between frictional head loss and frictional pressure drop is simply:</br></br>

Head Loss due to skin friction (<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><msub><mi>h</mi><mrow><mi>f</mi><mi>s</mi></mrow></msub></math>) can be related to wall shear.</br></br>

<img src="../images/CodeCogsEqn (15).gif" style="width:17px;height:11px"></img> is not conveniently determined so the dimensionless friction factor is introduced into the equations.</br>
</div></br>

  <li>Valid for Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids</li>
</ul> 
 
Correlations were made between the fanning friction factor and the Reynolds number for both
laminar and turbulent flow in a variety of pipes.</br>
For laminar flow, first principles can be used to develop a relation between
Reynolds number and friction factor. The Hagen-Poiseuille equation relates the
frictional pressure drop to fluid velocity, viscosity, and pipe dimension:</br></br>

<center><img src="../images/CodeCogsEqn (19).gif" style="width:146px;height:37px"></img>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8)</center></br></br>
Equating the pressure drop due to friction in the Hagen-Poiseuille equation given
by Eq.8, with the overall pressure drop across the pipe, and combining with the
Fanning equation given by Eq.7, results in relation for laminar flow as</br></br>
<center>f=16/N<sub>Re</sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9)</center><br>
</br></br>
A first principle analysis can not be used to develop a relation between friction
factor and Reynolds numbers for turbulent flow. A variety of empirical
correlations exist for turbulent flow in smooth pipes.
Blasius equations :</br></br>
<center><img src="../images/CodeCogsEqn (20).gif" style="width:117px;height:43px"></img>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(10)</center></br>

The above correlation is valid for
<img src="../images/CodeCogsEqn (21).gif" style="width:139px;height:19px"></img></br></br>

The Blasius equation is purely an empirical equation and has no theoretical basis,
but it is a convenient form for application. The entire turbulent region can be
represented by the von Kármán-Nikuradse equation:</br></br>

<center><img src="../images/CodeCogsEqn (22).gif" style="width:204px;height:42px"></img>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(11)</center></br>
for Re > 4000, turbulent</br>
</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
It has long been known that in turbulent flow a rough pipe leads to a larger
friction factor for a given Reynolds number than a smooth pipe does. If a rough
pipe is smoothed , the friction factor is reduced. When further smoothing brings
about no further reduction in friction factor for a given Reynolds number,the tube
is said to be hydraulically smooth.</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
In turbulent flow, the friction factor, f depends upon the Reynolds number and
on the relative roughness of the pipe, k/D, where, k is the roughness
parameter(average roughness height of the pipe) and D is the inner diameter of the
pipe. . The general behavior of turbulent pipe flow in the presence of surface
roughness is well established. When k is very small compared to the pipe diameter
D i.e. k/D->0, f depends only on N<sub></sub>Re. When k/D is of a significant value, at low
N<sub></sub>Re , the flow can be considered as in smooth regime (there is no effect of
roughness). As N<sub></sub>Re increases, the flow becomes transitionally rough, called as
transition regime in which the friction factor rises above the smooth value and is a
function of both k and NRe and as N<sub>Re</sub> increases more and more, the flow
eventually reaches a fully rough regime in which f is independent of N<sub>Re</sub> .</div></br>

<div style="text-indent: 30px;" id="wrap">
In a smooth pipe flow, the viscous sub layer completely submerges the effect of k
on the flow. In this case, the friction factor f is a function of NRe and is
independent of the effect of k on the flow.
In case of rough pipe flow, the viscous sub layer thickness is very small when
compared to roughness height and thus the flow is dominated by the roughness of
the pipe wall and f is the function only of k/D and is independent of N<sub>Re</sub> .
For design purposes, the frictional characteristics of round pipes,both smooth and
rough ,are summarized by the friction factor chart, which is a log-log plot of
Fanning friction factor (f ) vs N<sub>Re</sub> which is based on Moody&rsquo;s chart .</div></br>

                            Refer Moody’s chart wherever required for friction factor<br><br>
							
1. What is the skin frictional loss when water is flowing at 1.65 m/s through a horizontal 33m<br><br>
long pipe having inside diameter of 2.067inches and absolute roughness 0.0018 inch . Use
the following data:<br><br>

Density of water = 995 kg/m<sup>3</sup>, viscosity of water = 0.85cP<br><br>
Assume that inlet and exit points are at the same elevation and entrance and exit losses are<br>
negligible.<br><br>

2. Water with a coefficient of dynamic viscosity of 1.4 x 10 -3 NS/m<sup>2</sup> flows along a pipe 50mm
diameter. If the pipe has an absolute roughness of 0.0000 7m, calculate:<br><br>
a. The head lost due to friction per km of pipe<br>
b. The power required to overcome friction per km of pipe<br>
(i) For a flow rate of 3 litres/min<br>
(ii) For a flow rate of 40 litres/min<br><br>

3. Pressure drop in a water pipeline with turbulent flow is 25 psi for ordinary steel pipe.<br>
What would the pressure drop be if copper pipe were used? Hint: use coefficient of roughness<br>
